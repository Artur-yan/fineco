        Behind every purchase, there is an emotion and many of these spending habits are responding to needs deeply rooted in our universal human traits. The Infusive Consumer Alpha Global Leaders FAM Fund leverages consumer psychology to invest in those companies that focus on eliciting happiness. Happiness is the keyword of this branding process.

        We have developed the brand strategy and visual identity for the fund.

        *You canâ€™t buy happiness, but you can invest in it.*
