        Water and waste management are among the most crucial environmental
        challenges the world is currently facing.

        Fidelity Sustainable Water & Waste FAM Fund is a fund that invests globally in companies involved in the design, manufacture, or sale of products and services in connection with the water and waste management sectors.


        We have reflected this dualism by developing communication following two parallel directions: water and waste.

        Creating informative materials for Fineco Asset Managementâ€™s team of
        financial advisors, we have designed imagery to replicate the different
        visual elements of the two themes trying to make them talk to each other
        in an original way.


        Special attention was devoted to presenting a positive visual identity for a fund treating two Megatrends and environmental challenges.


        We have developed the branding, promotional and informative materials, and videos.
